PDFRasterizer.NET 3.0 has been compiled and tested with Microsoft Visual Studio.NET 2003, 2005 and 2008 for Microsoft .NET Frameworks 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 and 3.5. PDFRasterizer.NET is a 100% managed .NET component and consists of just a single assembly: TallComponents.PDF.Rasterizer.dll.



## Requirements

PDFRasterizer.NET 3.0 is compiled for versions 1.1, 2.0 and 3.0 of the Microsoft .NET framework. All three builds are included in the distribution.



## Development environment

To develop applications using PDFRasterizer.NET 3.0 any development environment for Microsoft .NET 1.1, 2.0, 3.0 or 3.5 framework will do.



## IntelliSense

The PDFRasterizer.NET 3.0 installation includes the XML documentation file TallComponents.PDF.Rasterizer.xml which documents all public types and members of PDFRasterizer.NET 3.0. If this XML file is in the same folder as the assembly, Visual Studio provides IntelliSense documentation as you type in your code.



## Deployment

PDFRasterizer.NET 3.0 is fully compatible with the XCopy deployment principle of .NET.
