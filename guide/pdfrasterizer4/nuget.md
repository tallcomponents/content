# NuGet

The previous version of PDFRasterizer.NET (3.0) was implemented as a single assembly that could be easily referenced and XCopy deployed. 
The current version 4.0 has dependencies that cannot be (easily) resolved manually. PDFRasterizer.NET 4.0 uses the NuGet package manager for .NET.

```
Install-Package TallComponents.PDFRasterizer4
```

IDE's such as Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET and JetBrains' Rider provide a user interface for installing the PDFRasterizer.NET 4.0 NuGet packag.

See PDFRasterizer.NET 4.0's page on nuget.org for details and history:
