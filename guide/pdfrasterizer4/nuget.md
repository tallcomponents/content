# NuGet

The previous version of PDFRasterizer.NET (3.0) was implemented as a single assembly that could be easily referenced and XCopy deployed. 
The current version 4.0 has dependencies that cannot be (easily) resolved manually. PDFRasterizer.NET 4.0 uses the NuGet package manager for .NET.

IDE's such as Microsoft's Visual Studio .NET and JetBrains' Rider provide a user interface for installing the PDFRasterizer.NET 4.0 NuGet packag.

PDFRasterizer.NET 4.0's page on nuget.org shows all ways to add this package to your project:
