# Developer Guide

This guide helps you understand the TallPDF.NET 5.0 class library. It walks through the main concepts and illustrates them with code samples. 

## Features

TallPDF.NET is a 100% managed (verifiable) .NET class library for dynamic generation of PDF documents. It consists of just a single assembly that can be xcopy-deployed. It has no dependencies other than the .NET framework. Central to TallPDF.NET is a consistent and highly intuitive object model consisting of classes like Document, Section, TextParagraph, Table, Header, Footer, etc. The focus of the development team is always to ease the task of integrating our class libray in a larger application.
